INTRODUCTION
------------

This plugin makes it easier to do (non-default-)joins.
Instead of the limited doSelectJoin(xxx) Peer-Methods you are now free to do any join (between any related tables and with any depth)
and let the result get hydrated automatically.

This helper extends the functionality of Propel, while keeping it completely backwards compatible.


INSTALLATION
------------

NOTE: be sure to have connection pooling enabled for your propel database (in your database.yml)
or else you will get more results than desired with right-joins (one-to-many relations)

In order to make use of this helper you should enable the peer and object builders provided by this plugin in the builder map.
you should change your config/propel.ini and set

propel.builder.peer.class              = plugins.sfPropelHelperPlugin.lib.builder.SfPeerBuilderDS
propel.builder.object.class            = plugins.sfPropelHelperPlugin.lib.builder.SfObjectBuilderDS

run
symfony propel:build-model and you have extended base peer and object classes.

There also is an important bug fix for Propel provided with this plugin, that
makes it possible to define select columns before you have provide table-aliasses.

To enable this patch copy two files to your propel folder:
  cp plugins/sfPropelHelperPlugin/patch/result\ after\ patch/* lib/vendor/symfony/lib/plugins/sfPropelPlugin/lib/vendor/propel/util/

(this was created at the time of Symfony 1.2.4)

I would like to get these improvements included into Propel, but it is somewhat hard to get into contact with the Propel community,
since everything you send gets marked as spam...


So far the difficult part.


EXAMPLE
-------

schema.yml:

propel:
  album:
    id:
    album_id:
    map:          varchar(255)
    title:        varchar(255)
    description:  LONGVARCHAR
  foto:
    id:
    album_id:
    filename:     varchar(255)
    title:        varchar(255)
    description:  LONGVARCHAR


Lets see that in action.class.php:
